About SPELLATHON - A Word Formation Game

It has the following rules:
- Make 4 or more letter words using the letters provided. There should be atleast one 7 letter word.
- A letter can be used as many times as it appears. Each word must contain the central letter.
- Plurals, foreign words and proper names are not allowed. British English Dictionary is used as refernce.

For example, letters are usually provided in such a hexagon and "G" will be considered the central
letter here. Possible solution/words would be: "DING", "BING", "BIDING" and "BIDDING".
